# Overview

This lab is designed to demonstrate how to use IBM Data Science Experience to build a predictive model within a Jupyter Notebook. The predictive model is then deployed to the Watson Machine Learning Service in Bluemix where it is consumed by users accessing a Node.js application.

![Flow](images/Picture35.png)

1. The developer creates an IBM Data Science Experience Workspace.
2. IBM Data Science Experience depends on an Apache Spark service.
3. IBM Data Science Experience uses Cloud Object storage to manage your data.
4. This lab is built around a Jupyter Notebook, this is where the developer will import data, train, and evaluate their model.
5. Import data on heart failure.
6. Trained models are deployed into production using IBM's Watson Machine Learning Service.
7. A Node.js web app is deployed on Bluemix calling the predictive model hosted in the Watson Machine Learning Service.
8. A user visits the web app, enters their information, and the predictive model returns a response.


## Prerequisites

* Bluemix supported [web browser](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/overview/prereqs.html#prereqs)
* An [IBM Bluemix Account](https://console.bluemix.net)

## Before you begin
To be able do this lab a Bluemix account is necessary. If you don't have one yet -- or you did not complete the initial set up of your Bluemix account -- follow the steps below.

Your account must have enough resources available for at least 1 application (128MB) and 4 services.

### Already registered and completed set-up

When you already registered and completed the initial set-up of your Bluemix account, you directly jump to [Create a space in Bluemix US region](#create-a-space-in-bluemix-us-region).

### Not registered

Use Ctrl-click (or the equivalent action for your system) to open the [Sign Up for Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/registration/trial) page in a separate tab. Fill in the form and click **Start your FREE Bluemix trial** to complete the registration. You will receive an activation mail in your inbox.

### First time login

Use Ctrl-click (or the equivalent action for your system) to open the [Login to Bluemix](https://console.bluemix.net/login) in a separate tab. First time users need to complete a 4-step wizard. This starts by accepting the terms & conditions.

  ![Terms & conditions][1]

Define a name for your organization.

  ![Organization name][2]

Choose a name for your space. Typically `dev` would be a good name for your first space.

  ![Space name][3]

On the last page, click **I'm Ready** to complete the set up process.

### Create a space in Bluemix US region (if not already there)

For the remainder of this lab we switch to the **US region** of Bluemix. For this, use Ctrl-click (or the equivalent for your system) to open the Bluemix dashboard. Click your account and choose **US South** as your active region.

![Select US region][5]

If you are all OK, you get the dashboard. Otherwise, you will be asked to create your first space in this region -- as depicted in the screenshot below. Typically `dev` would be a good name for your space.

![Create space in US][4]

### Download the sample patient data

Use Ctrl-click (or the equivalent action for your system) to open the <a href="https://ibm.box.com/v/patientdataV6" target=download>patientdataV6.csv</a> CSV file in a separate tab. Click **Download** to download this file to your own device.

  ![Download CSV][14]

Congrats, you're now ready to start your data science experience :smiley:!!

  ![Associated Services][27]

  12. Leave the browser tab open for later.

## Step 5: Save the credentials for your Watson Machine Learning Service

In this part of the lab you’ll save the credentials for your Watson Machine Learning instance so you can use it later in your code.

  1. In a different browser tab go to [http://console.bluemix.net](http://console.bluemix.net) and log in to the Dashboard

  2. Click on your Watson Machine Learning instance under **Services**.

  ![Save Credentials][28]

  3. Click on **Service credentials** and then on **View credentials** to see the credentials.

  ![View Credentials][29]

  4. Save the username and password to a text file on your machine. You’ll need this information later in your Jupyter notebook.

## Step 6: Create a notebook in IBM Data Science Experience

In this part of the lab you’ll create a Jupyter notebook and import the code to create a predictive model.

  1. In the Data Science Experience browser tab click on **Overview** and then click **add notebooks**.

  ![Add Notebook][15]

  2. Click on **From URL** and name the notebook _Apache Spark integration with Watson ML_.

  3. Under **Notebook URL** provide the following url: https://github.com/eciggaar/watson-dojo-pm-tester/blob/master/demo1.ipynb.

  ![Create Notebook][16]

  4. Click **Create Notebook** to create the new notebook.

  5. Leave your browser tab open for the next part.


## Step 7: Run the notebook in IBM Data Science Experience

In this part of the lab you will run the Jupyter Notebook code creating a predictive model, and save it in the Watson Machine Learning Service.

  1. Place your cursor in the first code block in the notebook.

  ![Insert Credentials Step 1](images/Picture23.png)

  2. Click on the **Find and Add** data icon -- see step 1 in diagram below -- and then select **Insert to code** under the file **patientdataV6.csv**. This is step 2 in diagram below. Finally select **Insert Credentials** -- which is step 3 in diagram below.

  ![Insert Credentials Step 2][30]

  3. Your Object Storage credentials should now be in the cell. Ensure the variable is `credentials_1`.

  ![Insert Credentials Step 3](images/Picture25.png)

  4. Click on the **Run** icon to run the code in the cell.

  ![Run Notebook][31]

  5. Move your cursor to each code cell and run the code in it. Read the comments for each cell to understand what the code is doing. **Important** when the code in a cell is still running, the label to the left changes to **In [\*]**:.
  Do **not** continue to the next cell until the code is finished running.

  6. When you get to the cell that says **Stop here !!!!** insert the username and password that you saved from your Watson Machine Learning instance into the code before running it.

  ![Run Notebook](images/Picture27.png)

  7. Continue running each cell until you finish the entire notebook.

## Step 8: Deploy the saved predictive model as a scoring service

In this part of the lab you’ll deploy the model you saved by running the Python notebook as a scoring service in Watson Machine Learning.

1. In a different browser tab go to [http://console.bluemix.net](http://console.bluemix.net) and log in to your dashboard.

2. Click on the entry for your Watson Machine Learning service under **Services**.

3. Click **Manage** and then click on the **Launch Dashboard** button in the Watson Machine Learning tile.

![Launch Dashboard][17]

4. Your saved model should appear. Under **Actions** select **Create Deployment**.

![Create Deployment Step 1][18]

5. Name the deployment _Heart Failure Prediction Model Deployment_ and click **Save**. Keep the type of deployment set to the default value 'Online'.

![Create Deployment Step 2][19]

6. Your model should now be deployed and visible as a Deployment with status 'ACTIVE'.

![Create Deployment Step 3][20]

7. Restart the Node.js Web App. For this, return to your Bluemix Dashboard and select the restart icon to restart the web application.

![Restart WebApp][32]


## Step 9: Test the deployed Model

In this part of the lab you’ll test the deployed model with the Node.js application that you deployed earlier.

1. Click on the application URL to open the application in a separate tab.

![Test Deployed Model][33]

3. When the application appears click on **Score now** to test the scoring model with the default values.  

4. Verify that the model predicts that there is a risk of heart failure for the patient with these medical characteristics.

![Score][34]

5. **Click Close**. Run the app again with the following parameters.

![Score](images/Picture33.png)

6. Verify that the model predicts that there is not a risk of heart failure for the patient with these medical characteristics.

![Score][35]]

Congratulations, you successfully created a predictive model in Apache Spark and deployed and tested it using the Watson Machine Learning Service in Bluemix :smiley:!!
